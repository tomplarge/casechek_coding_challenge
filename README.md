# Casechek Coding Interview

### Install (Mac OSX)
1. Be sure to have homebrew installed:
```
$ xcode-select --install
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

2. `cd` into project and run `install.sh`:
```
$ cd casechek_coding_challenge; sh install.sh
```
This may take a few minutes.

### Run
1. run `start.sh`:
```
$ sh start.sh
```
This should start up the flask app on `localhost:5000` in the terminal window. You should see a message that the app has started.
